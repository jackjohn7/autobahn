# autobahn

Free and Open-Source (FOSS) SCRUM and Kanban system. Autobahn users
are able to create unlimited projects.

No nonsense. Just a sleek UI, with features enabling a great degree
of customization to perfectly match your team's workflow.

# Planned features

Autobahn is a very early WIP. These are the planned features.


## Integrations

### GitHub Integrations

I would like to allow the user to tie GitHub repository issues and 
pull-requests to Autobahn Stories.

GitHub actions and webhook integrations could also be neat.

### GitLab Integrations

I'm not a GitLab user, but I'd like to ensure GitLab users are able 
to fully utilize Autobahn without feeling like they're missing any 
features available to GitHub users.

### Discord Integrations

For those that use Discord to communicate with team members, 
integrations with Discord via Bots or Webhooks can be useful.

### Autobahn Automations

Users should be able to define triggers and events in Autobahn to
automate certain tasks. For example, when a story moves from one 
status (Lane) to another, an HTTP request can be fired.

### JSON Import and Export

User should be able to import and export Autobahn projects in 
the form of JSON.

### RESTful API

Users should be able to request information about projects using
HTTP.
